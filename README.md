# Transform Todoist
Initially developed as a tool to convert the Todoist iCal into a more comprehensible format, the application now utilizes the API to retrieve all tasks.
This tool allows you to use an API token to create a link that creates an event for each day with tasks, and groups those tasks together in a nice overview.
It works best on proton calendar, which I use, but it also works on Google Calendar. 
The description of the event needs to support simple HTML to use this calendar.

Currently, it's only available in Dutch.
